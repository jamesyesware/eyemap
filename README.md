### Machine Learning Powered Auto-Email Detection


Machine learning is cool and hip and popular, so why *wouldn't* we do something with it? Our algorithm works to classify an email
as being either automatically generated (an out-of-office reply, for example) or genuine, which is to say written by a person. The only
data point we use is the subject of the email.

You can train our model and test it against some seperate emails to see what kind of results are possible. In our first tests, we were routinely
seeing 99.99% accuracy on arbitrary test input. Wow! What a time to be alive.

```python
from classify import Classifier

classifier = Classifier()
classifier.prepare_bag_of_words()
classifier.start_training(50000) # no. of epochs

test_subjects = [<list of real subjects that you did not train on!>]

classifier.practice_run(test_subjects)
```

That's the simplest way to see the model work. We will be updating the API to increase the usability/testability.
It's also worth noting that the `Classifier` class expects there to be a `data/` directory in the current directory that contains `training_data.json` and `test_data.json`.
Make sure these exist. You can get them from your pal. Now give my shirt, Github, this is my 4th PR.

This repo includes a couple implementations of the same solution. The `Classifier` class in `classify.py` uses a bag-of-words model, and is written
mostly using vanilla python with numpy and nltk for tokenization. The work in the `tensorflow` directory is a work-in-progress that aims to do the same
thing but more effieciently.
